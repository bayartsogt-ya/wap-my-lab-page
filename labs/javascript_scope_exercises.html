        1. Determine what this Javascript code will print out (without running it):

        [Answer]
        x = 1;
        var a = 5;
        var b = 10;
        var c = function(a, b, c) {
            var x = 10;
            document.write(x); // 10
            document.write(a); // 8
            var f = function(a, b, c) {
                b = a; // a=8, b=8, c=10
                document.write(b); // 8
                b = c; // b=8
                var x = 5;
            }
            f(a,b,c);
            document.write(b); // 9
        }
        c(8,9,10);
        document.write(b); // 10
        document.write(x); // 1
        }
        [Answer]
        // output => 10889101

        2. What is the difference between a method and function?

        [Answer]
        A function is called by name and works as a (first-class) variable while a method is only accessible from its object.

        3. What does 'this' refer to when used in a Java method?

        [Answer]
        "this" is nearest class itself.

        4. What does 'this' refer to when used in a JavaScript method?

        [Answer]
        It depends on context:
            - in function, this refers to the global object
            - in event handler, this refers to the current element that received that event
            - otherwise, this refers to global object

        5. What does 'this' refer to when used in a JavaScript constructor function?

        [Answer]
        "this" is object created inside constructor.

        6. Assume object x is the prototype for object y in Javascript. Object x has a method f( ) containing keyword 'this'.
        When f is called by x.f( ), what does 'this' refer to?

        [Answer]
        this refers x

        7. What is a free variable in JavaScript?

        [Answer]
        A variable that called by the current function but not one of its parameters or local variables.

        8. Create an object that has properties with name = "fred" and major="music" and a property that is a function
        that takes 2 numbers and returns the smallest of the two, or the square of the two if they are equal.

        [Answer]
        var ob = (() => {
            return {
                'name': 'fred',
                'major': 'music',
                'someFunc': (num1, num2) => {
                    if (num1 === num2) {
                        return num1 ** 2 + num2 ** 2;
                    } else if ((num1 > num2)) {
                        return num2;
                    } else {
                        return num1;
                    }
                }
            }
        })();

        9. Write Javascript code for creating three Employee objects using the "new" keyword and a constructor function.
        Employee objects have the following fields: name, salary, position.
        
        [Answer]
        function Employee(name, salary, position) {
            this.name = name;
            this.salary = salary;
            this.position = position;
        };

        10. Write a Javascript function that takes any number of input arguments and returns the product of the
        arguments.

        [Answer]
        var findProduct = (...values) => {
            return eval(values.join('*'));
        }

        11. Write an arrow function that returns the maximum of its three input arguments.
        
        [Answer]
        var findMax = (num1, num2, num3) => {
            return Math.max(num1, num2, num3);
        }
