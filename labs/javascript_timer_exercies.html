        > What is "Unobtrusive Javascript"?: 
        Writing javascript as a completely separate file. 

        > What is the practical application of Unobtrusive Javascript (and the reasons for using it)?
        No JS code inside HTML. (even no function call inside button tag, such as onclick)

        Main reason is the sepration of concepts:
            - content (html)
            - presentation (css)
            - behavior (js)
